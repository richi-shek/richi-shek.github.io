<p>Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation</p>
<h2 id="planning-phases"><a class="anchor" name="planning-phases" href="#planning-phases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Planning phases</h2>
<p>The planning phase is the fundamental process of understanding why an information system should be built, and determining how the project team will go about building it.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-phases"><a class="anchor" name="analysis-phases" href="#analysis-phases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis phases</h2>
<p>The analysis phase answers the questions of who will use the system, what the system will do, and where and when it will be used.</p>
<h3 id="three-steps-of-analysis-phase"><a class="anchor" name="three-steps-of-analysis-phase" href="#three-steps-of-analysis-phase"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>THREE steps of Analysis phase?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Analysis strategy<blockquote>
<p>This is developed to guide the projects team's efforts. This includes a study of the current system and its problems, and envisioning ways to design a new system</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Requirements gathering<blockquote>
<p>The analysis of this information leads to the development of a concept for a new system. This concept is used to build a set of analysis models.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>System proposal<blockquote>
<p>The proposal is presented to the project sponsor and other key individuals who decide whether the project should continue to move forward.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="design-phases"><a class="anchor" name="design-phases" href="#design-phases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design phases</h2>
<p>The design phase decides how the system will operate, in terms of the hardware, software, and network infrastructure; the user interface, forms, and reports that will be used; and the specific programs, databases, and files that will be needed.</p>
<h3 id="four-steps-of-design-phase"><a class="anchor" name="four-steps-of-design-phase" href="#four-steps-of-design-phase"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FOUR steps of Design phase.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Design Strategy<blockquote>
<p>This clarifies whether the system will be developed by the company or outside the company.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Architecture Design<blockquote>
<p>This describes the hardware, software, and network infrastructure that will be used.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Database and File Specifications<blockquote>
<p>These documents define what and where the data will be stored.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Program Design<blockquote>
<p>Defines what programs need to be written and what they will do.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="implementation-phases"><a class="anchor" name="implementation-phases" href="#implementation-phases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation phases</h2>
<p>During the implementation phase, the system is either developed or purchased and installed.</p>

<ol>
<li>System Construction<blockquote>
<p>The system is built and tested to make sure it performs as designed.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Installation<blockquote>
<p>The old system is turned off and the new one is turned on.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Support Plan<blockquote>
<p>Includes a post-implementation review as well as a systematic way for identifying changes needed for the system.</p>

<h3 id="waterfall-development"><a class="anchor" name="waterfall-development" href="#waterfall-development"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Waterfall Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>A linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase depends on the previous one and has specific deliverables. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to follow, but the disadvantage is that it is rigid and does not allow for changes or feedback during the process.
<img src="./img/1.jpg" alt="image info"></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="parallel-development"><a class="anchor" name="parallel-development" href="#parallel-development"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parallel Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>A variation of waterfall development, where different phases are performed in parallel by different teams. The advantage is that it reduces development time and risks, but the disadvantage is that it requires more coordination and communication among teams.
<img src="./img/2.jpg" alt="image info"></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v-model"><a class="anchor" name="v-model" href="#v-model"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>V-model</h3>
<ul>
<li>A graphical representation of a systems development lifecycle, where each testing phase corresponds to a development phase in an inverted V-shape. The advantage is that it ensures high quality and verification of requirements, but the disadvantage is that it is inflexible and does not handle changing requirements well.
<img src="./img/3.jpg" alt="image info"></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iterative-development"><a class="anchor" name="iterative-development" href="#iterative-development"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Iterative Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>An approach that divides the software development into smaller cycles or iterations, where each iteration produces a working version of the software. The advantage is that it allows for feedback and improvement along the way, but the disadvantage is that it can be difficult to manage complexity and scope creep.
<img src="./img/4.jpg" alt="image info"></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="system-prototyping"><a class="anchor" name="system-prototyping" href="#system-prototyping"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System prototyping</h3>
<ul>
<li>A type of prototyping where a functional model of the system is built quickly and tested by users before developing the final system. The advantage is that it helps validate user requirements and expectations, but the disadvantage is that it can be costly and time-consuming to refine or discard prototypes.
<img src="./img/5.jpg" alt="image info"></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="throwaway-prototyping"><a class="anchor" name="throwaway-prototyping" href="#throwaway-prototyping"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Throwaway prototyping</h3>
<ul>
<li>A type of prototyping where a simple model of the system is built only to explore a specific aspect or feature, and then discarded after getting feedback from users or stakeholders. The advantage is that it helps clarify ambiguous or complex requirements, but the disadvantage is that it can lead to waste or confusion if not managed properly.

</ul>
<h3 id="agile-development"><a class="anchor" name="agile-development" href="#agile-development"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Agile Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>A set of principles and practices for software development that emphasize collaboration, flexibility, customer satisfaction, and continuous delivery. The advantage is that it adapts to changing needs and delivers value faster, but the disadvantage is that it requires more discipline and communication among team members.

<li>Operational costs<blockquote>
<p>are expense that are required to operate the system, usually thought of as ongoing costs.</p>
